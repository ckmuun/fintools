# Hypotheses 

## 0. Retail investors active on social trading platforms are under-diversified
First thought: If we look at, for example, public.com we see a lot of people investing in hot stocks from the tech industry or consumer-known brands like retail, fast food or consumer goods.
This generally contradicts the classic notion of a well-diversified portfolio.  

## 1. Rapid means of information spread are causing hype-cycles stronger than the traditionally-known stock exchange hypes
See GME short-squeeze. Currently the party's still going on, however if the calls mature we'll probably see it plummeting. 

The power of institutional investors / hedge funds to influence the market
decreases because retail investors can form a powerful counterweight as seen in GME short-squeeze.


## 2. Retail investors are hindering their effort to reach financial independence by using fast-paced mobile trading
Cases of Robinhood-induced bankruptcy are surging. Even one directly atrributable suicide  was recorded so far. 

Hyperbolic discounting: Humans generally have a preference for present consumption (desire for a short-term success in the stock market) rather than optimal behavior (maximizing future consumption). Behavioral Finance
plays a big role. Robo-Advising could help to counter behavioral biases.


## 3. As brokers like Robinhood earn their money with order-routing instead of direct fees, the retail investor pays via stock prices.

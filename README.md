Colloquial title "Never Work Again - Tools to achieve financial freedom"

## Introduction
The world of (personal) finance is shifting rapidly, both in terms of tooling and in terms of  target groups. <\br>
People who traditionally had no proper access to wealth managemnt products can now use quite a few tools that allow them to participiate in the financial markets. <\p>

Although the overarching trend is the same, we observe different kinds of products that fulfill the demand by  retail investors, they vastly differ in execution. 
For example, Robinhood basically provides a powerful tool to the end user, but that's it. There is no direct notion of wealth management by professionals to it. <\br> 
Other companies like scalable capital employ a different approach which can is significantly more long-term. <\p>

But all these products are just means to an end, as it is relatively safe to assume that most people desire an increase of their funds, not really the interaction with these products. <\br>

This research project aims to cluster and categorize various tools and providing guidance on which one may be best suitable for different lifestyle and investor types.
